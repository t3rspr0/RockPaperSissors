if player in options:
	print("Stuff")

is kinda the same thing as:


if player == "rock" or player == ""paper" or player == "scissors":
	print("Stuff")

but we need to use everything the language gives us


-------------------------------------------------------------------

if check_winner(player, computer):
	{condition}

is the same as:

if check_winner(player, computer) == True:
	{condition} ---> in this case, the player would win
